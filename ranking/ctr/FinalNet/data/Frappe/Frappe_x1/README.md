# Frappe_x1

+ **Dataset description:**

  The Frappe dataset contains a context-aware app usage log, which comprises 96203 entries by 957 users for 4082 apps used in various contexts. It has 10 feature fields including user_id, item_id, daytime, weekday, isweekend, homework, cost, weather, country, city. The target value indicates whether the user has used the app under the context. Following the [AFN](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5768) work, we randomly split the data into 7:2:1 as the training set, validation set, and test set, respectively. 

  The dataset statistics are summarized as follows:

  | Dataset Split  | Total | #Train | #Validation | #Test | 
  | :--------: | :-----: |:-----: | :----------: | :----: | 
  | Frappe_x1 |  288,609   | 202,027  |  57,722    | 28,860    |
